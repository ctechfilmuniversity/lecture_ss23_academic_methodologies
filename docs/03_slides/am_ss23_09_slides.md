* Abstract
* Introduction
* Related Work
* Main Content
    * Algorithm, Setup, Study, etc.
    * Results
    * Evaluation
    * Discussion
* Future Work
* Conclusion
* Acknowledgements

## Writing A Paper - Final Thoughts

> Repeat yourself while never repeating text...

--

A common mistake is to repeat the same phrases, sentences etc.  
  
However, you have to bring up your main points over and over again e.g. to lead the reader through your paper.

## Writing A Paper - Final Thoughts

> In academic writing, everything you say must directly be proofed in some form. 

--

* "The problem is difficult."
* "The method is fast."
* "The high quality of the results..."
* "The results look good."
* "As it can be seen‚Ä¶", "It has been shown..."  
  

Question all your statements and see **if the text answers to everything**. 

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* For this also see the section about citations.


Now, that we know what to write, let's talk about the look, meaning the layout of a paper. As we all know, looks are important - that is just human nature. Unfortunately the world of paper writing is not as progressive as our world is (hopefully) slowly changing to the appreciation of all shapes, sizes and colors, moving away from standards, appreciating diversity and individuality. A beautiful paper, however, very much needs to follow standards. But of course - as in real life - the real beauty of a paper comes from within, and if the content of the paper is rubbish, the layout can not fix that.

# Layout

---
## Layout

A paper should have a strong visual structure.  
  
Use section, sub-sections and bullet points. 
  
>  Good layout gives a reader an intuitive understanding of the paper on first glance.

For most paper submissions the venue will provide a set of rules for the text format and usually also a template for that. 


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* If in doubt, rather use a subsection to many than to few. Good layout gives a reader an intuitive understanding of the paper on first glance. My thesis advisor said to me for example that he can approximate a rough grade of a thesis, just by looking at its layout. And I think there is some truth to that. Also, I had it happened to me more than once that I thought I had structured my document well and it was given back to me with the comment that it needs more structure in the layout... A strong structure also helps to convey your content if there is a slight change that someone will only skim your text, e.g. for an application or expose where there are many submissions and some people are only superficially involved in the selection process.

I really can not give you any rules here to follow for structuring your text. It just depends on the content and its context. The only rule is: structure your text well with sections, subsections, bullet points and figures.  

* You must stay within the given format, your paper might otherwise be rejected for just the wrong layout. Minor cheats, or let's call them tweaks, are ok as long as they are not really noticeable.

# Language


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Of course, correct spelling and grammar is a must in academic writing. If you want to improve your grammar (and yes, I know, I myself have still some issues here - did someone say commata?!) there is a universe of resources for that from our friend, the internet. I particularly like to check in with grammar test, such as the [grammar book](http://www.grammarbook.com/interactive_quizzes_exercises.asp).

*What do you think we need to look out for in terms of language?*

---
.header[Language]

## Precision

* Clean, simple language
* Rule of thumb: use as few words as possible

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* One of the golden rules for the language of academic writing is - in all disciplines - to be precise. However, what preciseness means differs from discipline to discipline. In our context is means clean, somewhat simple language.


*  The language must not give a reader any extra thinking to do - the content is difficult enough on its own. The value of the work is in your research project contributions and the language should make those aspects clear, not obscure what you did with complicated language. You will notice for yourself that some writings try to hide weak results, thoughts, etc. behind complex language.


* When working with native English speakers as a native German speaker the aspect of simple language is especially difficult. Simple German is in comparison to simple English still ten times more complex. Whenever I work with native English speakers they still simplify my sentences... ü§¨ (the learning never stops...).

The website [daily writing tips](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/) describes the following helpful [techniques for more precise writing](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/10-techniques-for-more-precise-writing/)

# Style

---
## Style

In academic writing you must avoid

* emotional language,
* flowery language,
* exaggerations and superlatives.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Overall though, writing style simply is subjective. If you give your paper to experienced writers they will be affected by their personal style and will give you many, many corrections. These corrections might not improve errors but might just try to make the text match more the personal writing style of the corrector. Take in the feedback, reflect on it but also stand your ground if your personal writing style is different.

# Citations


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* For documenting the research goals of novelty and relevance we need to put our work into context. In academia, ideally everything you do must be based on something that has already been published. For that we reference other papers and now we have a look onto the formal style of citing other work.

---
## Citations

* Direct citations
    * Exact words are copied and put into ‚Äú‚Äù
    * Very uncommon in Computer Science, only used with definitions, e.g. 
        * Standard Y defines X as ‚Äû‚Ä¶‚Äú [5]
* **Citing the meaning **
    * Summarizing, paraphrasing, ‚Ä¶
    * It needs to be clear where the citation starts and stops
    * This basically means that you re-write the content
        * Smith et al. [2] found ‚Ä¶
* Short reference
    * List of related work and/or used techniques
        * We applied approach X [2] to ‚Ä¶

---
.header[Citations]

## Citation Style

--

A citation style defines

* which information is necessary for a citation,
* how to order the information, 
* punctuation and formatting.

Correct and clean citations are a must-have in academia. The golden rule here is *consistency* and not so much which style to use. 
  

???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* Citation styles make reference lists and bibliographies consistent and easy to read across different papers.

## Citation Style

It is up to you to decide where in the text to spell out authors names as reference as in-text citation and where to use shorter citation tags:

* Smith et al. [SJT12] demonstrate in their work about...
* ... developed in the context of architectural designs [LWW08], tree modeling [PSK‚àó12] and the creation of natural scenes [EVC‚àó15].


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* For in text citations and author-based references, the list of authors is shortened:

* ‚ÄòSmith and Jones‚Äô for up to two authors
* ‚Äòet al.‚Äô for ‚Äòand others‚Äô for more
    * Smith and Jones [SJ12]
    * Smith et al. [SJT12], [SJT*12] (for more than three authors)


You will often see a DOI included in a references auch as `DOI: 10.1002/asi.20801`. The DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a unique number used to identify a specific article.

It takes a lot of time to clean the information for a reference so that it shows up correctly. Different document types need different information. Sometimes your will need to collect the required information manually. I find the [tool](http://www.citethisforme.com) and the information on [cite this for me](http://www.citethisforme.com/guides) helpful.

If you are using a LaTeX template given out by the publication venue, the style comes with the template as `\bibliographystyle{style_name}`. You still need to setup your references accordingly, meaning the bibtex entries must be correct and complete.

> LaTeX follows the principles of separating presentation from content.


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* LaTeX, which is pronounced "Lah-tech" or "Lay-tech" (to rhyme with ¬´blech¬ª or ¬´Bertolt Brecht¬ª as the X is the greek letter chi), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content.

\end{document}
```
]


???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* LaTeX is based on the idea that it is better to leave document design to document designers, and to let authors get on with writing documents. So, in LaTeX you would input this document as:
* Or, in English:
    * This document is an article.
    * Its title is Cat Preferences for Different Box Sizes.
    * Its author is Jane Doe.
    * It was written in September 2020.
    * The document consists of a title followed by the text Hello world!

.task[COMMENT:]  

* The underlying TEX computer program, created by Donald E. Knuth, is aimed at typesetting text and mathematical formulae. TEX as we use it today is still pretty much the same as the release version in 1982, with some slight enhancements added in 1989 to better support 8-bit characters and multiple languages. TEX is renowned for being extremely stable, for running on many different kinds of computers, and for being virtually bug free. The version number of TEX is converging to œÄ and is now at 3.141592653.
* LaTeX uses TeX as its formatting engine and enables authors to typeset and print their work with high typographical quality, using a predefined layout. In a LaTeX environment, LaTeX takes the role of the book designer and uses TEX as its typesetter. But LaTeX is only a program and the author has to provide additional information to describe the logical structure of the work. This information is written into the text as LaTeX commands.
* Hence, LaTeX is a markup language and not WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). You need to compile the pdf. Tags define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylize text throughout a document (such as bold and italic), and to add citations and cross-references.

With LaTeX comes BibTeX. BibTeX is a reference management software for formatting lists of references. 
  
???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* A BibTeX database of references is stored as a `.bib` file, which you write as plain text file. References and citations are then automatically created and formatted based on the `.bib` file. Most literature management tools import/export BibTeX entries.

*On the left you see the .bib file and on the right the automatically produced reference list.*
* Once again, you still have to take care of the bib entries in the `.bib` file yourself. To create a consistent and complete BibTeX list of references for a paper takes forever‚Ä¶ be aware!
* LaTeX and BibTeX files have the advantage that they are simple text files, which fit well to version control systems such as GitHub. In comparison, such version control system often have problems with the tracking of changes in `.docx` files, for example. As with other coding projects, you only commit the source files not their build.

* The results of this paper are **not reasonable**.
* This paper is disappointing as it **lacks novelty**.
* [‚Ä¶] the paper describes a longer list of minor changes to an existing algorithm. [‚Ä¶] reuses a lot of established concepts [‚Ä¶] **does not seem to lead to fundamental new insights** or **significant technical challenges**.
* This paper does not seem to advance the state-of-the-art in any way. 
*  [‚Ä¶] would **not** consider the paper **a major practical break-through**.
* I'm not very enthusiastic about the paper [‚Ä¶]
* [‚Ä¶] make the results **hardly meaningful**.
* I am **skeptical of the value** of the presented studies.
The problem addressed in the paper **does not seem very new** and the proposed algorithms also **do not offer any particular insights**. Therefore, I think this paper **is not significant enough**.
* The manuscript also fails to present the (rather simple) technique in a concise (and correct) way.

## Bibliometrics

### Short Story: Citations count!

--

There are several "standards" that count citations, e.g., the impact factor (IF), h-index, i10,index, etc.





???
.task[COMMENT:]  

* $IF_y = \frac{Citations_{y-1} + Citations_{y-2}}{Publications_{y-1} + Publications_{y-2}}$
* Impact factor (*influence of a venue*): Average citation count for an article over two years

* The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor is an index that reflects the yearly average number of citations that articles published in the last two years in a given journal received. 
* The h-index is an author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar.

* Research, especially basic and fundamental work, often needs more time to be cited
* Journals are edited
