Some of these questions are optional. If you don't have, for example, further questions about the conference you don't have to submit anything.

## Questions 1 - Topics & Syllabus

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?
* Are there any topics regarding academic work missing that would interest you or where you need help with?

## Question 2 - Research

Explain, what might Einstein have meant in regard to research with saying:

   > Any fool can know. The point is to understand.

## Questions 3 - Your Paper

Collect topics and keywords as bullet points that could be of interest for you for your paper.  

I recommend to brainstorm for 15min and to write down whatever comes to your mind.
