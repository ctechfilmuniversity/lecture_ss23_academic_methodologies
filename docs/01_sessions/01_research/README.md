## Topics & Syllabus

* Recap the [Syllabus](../../index.md) of this class.

### Task 01.01

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?
* Are there any topics regarding academic work missing that would interest you or where you need help with?
  
*Submission:* Submit your answers.

## ACS FUB 2023

* Recap [Chapter 01 - ACS FUB 2023](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_01_conference_script.md) about the final project for this class, which is a conference simulation. If you have further questions, let me know next time in class.

## Research

* Recap [Chapter 02 - Research](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_02_research_script.md)

### Task 01.02

Think about what Einstein might have meant in regard to research with saying:

   > Any fool can know. The point is to understand.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question but we will discuss the answer in class.

## Reasoning

* Read [Chapter 03 - Reasoning](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_03_reasoning_script.md)
    * The content is meant for a broader understanding of the topic. If you are not interested in that, you can skim the script. 

### Task 01.03

Within the context of Creative Technologies:

1. Come up with a falsifiable hypothesis.
2. Come up with a non-falsifiable hypothesis.
3. Give a specific example for inductive reasoning.
4. Give a specific example for deductive reasoning.
5. Describe briefly a possible research project following the scientific method.
6. Come up with a research question, which should be answered with a quantitative approach.
7. Come up with a research question, which should be answered with a qualitative approach.

Your answers are allowed to be completely made-up and do not need to be realistically doable by you. However, I would like to encourage you to spend a little bit more time and effort to come up with answers that are of actual interest to you and that might fit to your 1st term project and / or general area of interest and / or your paper for this class. 

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question but we will discuss the answers in class.

## Your Paper

### Task 01.04 - Topic Brainstorming

Collect topics and keywords as bullet points that could be of interest for you for your paper.  

I recommend to brainstorm for 20 minuets and to write down whatever comes to your mind.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question.

### Task 01.05 - Topic Selection

From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper. 

Further think about on them. E.g. 

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* What questions could you ask within that topic? 
* How could you solve those questions? 


*Submission:* Submit your three topic choices and explain them briefly. If you already have possible questions within those topics, also submit them.

Answer all questions directly in a copy of the `am_ss23_XX_questions.md` file. Submit your copy as `am_ss23_XX_questions_lastname.md` in your assignments folder in a separate folder for each session. I prefer only lower-case characters.

For example: `assignments/gieseke/01/am_ss23_01_questions_gieseke.md`
