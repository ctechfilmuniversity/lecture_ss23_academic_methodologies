# Session 08 - Publishing

This session should not take longer than 3h.

## Chapter 10 - Academic Publishing

* Read [Chapter 10 - Academic Publishing](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_10_publishing_script.md)

At this point in your career the chapter is not that important. It is enough if you skim the paper.

*Submission*: -


## Your Paper (Optional)

Write a short abstract (<= 1000 characters) for your paper. 

* You do not need to re-use this abstract later on for your actual paper - but you can!  
* If you submit your abstract by July 3rd, I will have a look at it and give you feedback before the lecture-free time.

Submit your abstract as `am_ss23_08_abstract_lastname.md` in your assignments folder.

**Happy Publishing!**
