# Session 06 - Working With Literature

We will discuss this session on **June 15th**.  

This session should not take longer than 2h.


## Academic Writing

* Read [Chapter 09 - Academic Writing](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_09_writing_script.md)

Again, this chapter is rather important and I recommend that you carefully read the whole chapter. You need to apply the script's content when writing your paper.

*Submission*: -

## Your Writing

Reflect on your past experiences with writing, e.g. when writing your Bachelor thesis. 

* Think about what worked well and what didn't.
* What do you think in retrospect might have helped you with the problems you faced?
* If you had to come up with a routine for yourself right now to write your e.g. your master thesis, how would it look like?

*Submission*: -


## Your Paper

Make an overview of the different sections (and sub-sections) of your paper. Name your sections appropriately.

*Submission*: Submit your list of sections. Bullet points are fine.
