## Questions 01 - Example

Come up with a qualitative study design from the field of Creative Technologies. Describe which method you would chose for the project and why that is the best choice in your eyes? How would you analyze your data, e.g. give a rough overview of the coding.

## Research on video game usage among university students.

The goal of this research would be to get an overview about University students' video game consumption.

For my research I would combine several methods like surveys, focus groups and Time Diaries:


1. First, I'd map the amount of (video)gamers among students with a survey.
   1. I'd like to find out, if there's any relations between the study-field, gender, sexual orientation, year of study and the types of games played, number of hours spent.
2. After analyzing the data, I'd invite people who answered the survey to focus-group conversation, based on the types of games they play. My goal here would be to get more in depth data about how and why they play, who they're playing with.
3. The time spent with video-games is an important factor. To measure this, I'd ask some participants, who would represent different extremes (e.g. playing every day more then 3h <-> a few hours/month) to fill out time-diaries over a monthly period, so I can compare their time management. 

Coding the closed-ended surveys as well as the focus-group talks sounds quite uneasy. I'd probably label the answer-givers deductively based on the survey-answers (e.g. study course, gender, type of played games, amount of time spent). For the coding of the answers, I'd use a hieratchical system, to store label their approach to the fact that they're gamers. Here's some possible tags (they're this explanatory for non-fielders to understand):

    1. Satisfied with their gaming habits
       1. Learns from games
          1. Uni related learning
          2. Reflex-training
       2. Gaming as relaxation
       3. Gaming for human-connections
          1. Can play with friends from other cities
          2. Can play with new friends
       4. Happy about the time spent playing
    2. Unsatisfied with their gaming habits
       1. Feels addicted
       2. Unhappy about the time spent playing (maybe doesn't have enough time to play)
       3. Unhappy about their setup in the studying environment (e.g. dormitory)


## Task 3: Feedback for Paper

    I came up with a new research question (edited in [my 4th assignment](../04/am_ss22_04_questions_gasparik.md) ). I'd like to mainly consult about that, and the time I should spend with each part of the paper (study preparation, study, writing).

Formulate all answers in proper English.
