# Session 06 - Qualitative Research

We will discuss this session on **June 1st**.  

This session should not take longer than 2h.

## Qualitative Research

* Read [Chapter 08 - Qualitative Research Methods and Analysis](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_07_qualitativeresearch_script.md)

*Submission*: -
  
## Example Research

Come up with a qualitative study design from the field of Creative Technologies. Describe which method you would chose for the project and why is that the best choice in your opinion? How would you analyze your data, e.g. give a rough overview of the coding.

*Submission*: You do not need to submit anything but you will need to present your ideas in class.

## Your Paper

Think about the approach you want to use for your paper. Which methods with which steps do you want to use?  
  
This question does not aim to find your personal journey of investigation. Your task is to define the approach that you will present in a paper as your methodology.  
  

*Submission*: Submit a description of your approach. Bullet points are fine.
