# Session 05 - Statistics in a Nutshell

We will discuss this session on **May 25th**.  

This session should not take longer than 2h.

## Statistics in a Nutshell

* Read [Chapter 06 - Statistics in a Nutshell](../../02_scripts/am_ss22_06_statistics_script.md)
* Optional: read article [Paradigmenwechsel - Warum statistische Signifikanztests abgeschafft werden sollten](Forschung_Lehre_6_2020_Paradigmenwechsel.pdf) (very interesting!)

Possible questions I might ask next time in class:

* What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?
* When is the mean not representative for a data set and why?
* What is a normal distribution? Why is it important to test whether a data sample is normally distributed?
* What statistical method can be used to compare two group means contributed by two independent groups?
* When should a one-way ANOVA test be used? Describe a research question that fits the one-way ANOVA test.

*Submission*: You do not need to submit anything for this sessions.

## OPTIONAL: Misuse of Statistics and/or Visualizations?

Do you know of any further examples for misleading or even the faulty use statistics or data visualizations? If so, please share!

*Submission*: Submit any links, images etc. in a copy of this file.
