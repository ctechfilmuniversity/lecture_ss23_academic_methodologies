## Session 02 - HCI (10 Points)

This session is due on **Thursday, May 4** (please make your submission 1h before class) and we will discuss the results also on that day.

* [Session 02 - HCI (10 Points)](#session-02---hci-10-points)
* [HCI \& Finding a Research Question](#hci--finding-a-research-question)

## HCI & Finding a Research Question

* Read [Chapter 04 - HCI](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_04_hci_script.md)

### Task 02.01

Which research conflicts or trade-offs are relevant for Creative Technologies?  
Give at least one example.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question but we will discuss the answers in class.

## Your Paper

### Task 02.02 - The Storyline of Your Paper

Write down at least three possible (research) questions for your paper. 

* Don't worry about making the question a *research* question. You can think of the questions also as defining the direction for the *storyline* of your paper.
* One question represents one paper (for short papers one question is enough, each question should stand for a different paper)
* Questions can refer to different topics. I recommend to develop for each topic that your are still considering, multiple questions.
  
*Submission:* Submit your possible questions.

Answer all questions directly in a copy of the `am_ss23_XX_questions.md` file. Submit your copy as `am_ss23_XX_questions_lastname.md` in your assignments folder in a separate folder for each session. I prefer only lower-case characters.

For example: `assignments/gieseke/01/am_ss23_01_questions_gieseke.md`

**Happy Questioning!**
