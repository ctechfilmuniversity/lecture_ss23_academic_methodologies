## Topics & Syllabus

* Recap the [Syllabus](../../index.md) of this class.

### Task 01.01

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?

Maybe it is learning the LaTeX and general offical way of academic approach.

* Are there any topics regarding academic work missing that would interest you or where you need help with?

No, I think that over time and reading some research pappers will help me understand.
  
*Submission:* Submit your answers.

## ACS FUB 2023

* Recap [Chapter 01 - ACS FUB 2023](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_01_conference_script.md) about the final project for this class, which is a conference simulation. If you have further questions, let me know next time in class.

## Research

* Recap [Chapter 02 - Research](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_02_research_script.md)

### Task 01.02

Think about what Einstein might have meant in regard to research with saying:

   > Any fool can know. The point is to understand.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question but we will discuss the answer in class.

## Reasoning

* Read [Chapter 03 - Reasoning](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_03_reasoning_script.md)
    * The content is meant for a broader understanding of the topic. If you are not interested in that, you can skim the script. 

### Task 01.03

Within the context of Creative Technologies:

1. Come up with a falsifiable hypothesis.
2. Come up with a non-falsifiable hypothesis.
3. Give a specific example for inductive reasoning.
4. Give a specific example for deductive reasoning.
5. Describe briefly a possible research project following the scientific method.
6. Come up with a research question, which should be answered with a quantitative approach.
7. Come up with a research question, which should be answered with a qualitative approach.

Your answers are allowed to be completely made-up and do not need to be realistically doable by you. However, I would like to encourage you to spend a little bit more time and effort to come up with answers that are of actual interest to you and that might fit to your 1st term project and / or general area of interest and / or your paper for this class. 

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question but we will discuss the answers in class.

## Your Paper

### Task 01.04 - Topic Brainstorming

Collect topics and keywords as bullet points that could be of interest for you for your paper.  

I recommend to brainstorm for 20 minuets and to write down whatever comes to your mind.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question.

### Task 01.05 - Topic Selection

From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper. 

Further think about on them. E.g. 

1. Usage of amateur technology military and civil defence in time of war.
2. Bias in Academia and Historiography
3. Music for deaf people and deaf musicians.

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 

1. I would like to research how can civilians use technology to defend their lives or country.
I got the idea from a real life event happend during NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, where radio amateurs used to sabotage NATO planes and rockets,
and coordinate and support logistics for humanitarian and civil protection.

* What further characteristics does the topic have? 

1. 
2. 
3. 


* What questions could you ask within that topic? 

1. How can we use the technologe we use today in times of such crisis.
    What war technologies are used today?

    2. Is Academia biased in any way?

3. Are there any deaf musicians? How do they distinguish tones?

* How could you solve those questions? 

1. I would do a reasearch - that would be the main part, right?
2. I would focus mainly on getting to know how Academia works and prooves the papers.
3. I would do a reasearch.



*Submission:* Submit your three topic choices and explain them briefly. If you already have possible questions within those topics, also submit them.

Answer all questions directly in a copy of the `am_ss23_XX_questions.md` file. Submit your copy as `am_ss23_XX_questions_lastname.md` in your assignments folder in a separate folder for each session. I prefer only lower-case characters.

For example: `assignments/gieseke/01/am_ss23_01_questions_gieseke.md`
