Task 02.02 - The Storyline of Your Paper

Write down at least three possible (research) questions for your paper.

    Don't worry about making the question a research question. You can think of the questions also as defining the direction for the storyline of your paper.
    One question represents one paper (for short papers one question is enough, each question should stand for a different paper)
    Questions can refer to different topics. I recommend to develop for each topic that your are still considering, multiple questions.
    
    Topic: Using Technologies in a Creative way during wartime.
    1. Can we, as CTech students, contribute to civil defense in wartime?
    2. How can we approach such a problem, also regarding modern warfare tehchnology?
    3. How is it possible to integrate a creative-technical solution to a real-life situation, also regarding the dangers involved and the responsibilty?
    
    Topic: How can deaf people percieve and express a musical sentence?
    1. How different deaf people percieve and express individual sounds.
    2. How do they differentiate different tones?
    3. Can this be transcribed into a visual language?
    

Submission: Submit your possible questions.

Answer all questions directly in a copy of the am_ss23_XX_questions.md file. Submit your copy as am_ss23_XX_questions_lastname.md in your assignments folder in a separate folder for each session. I prefer only lower-case characters.

For example: assignments/gieseke/01/am_ss23_01_questions_gieseke.md
