City dwellers rely on the UX quality of public transport apps for frictionless transportation. In the influential essay "Magic Ink" Bret Victor presents an application design philosophy for information software. Comparing Berlin's public transport app to this design philosophy reveals that it's far from being actually applied. Tram, bus and subway riders could benefit immensely from seeing the potential of public transport apps fulfilled by the implementation of these design ideas.

Overall the abstract is good to go. You might want to emphasize stronger your actual task and achieved results.
  
My suggestions (feel free to ignore it :)):
  
City dwellers rely on the UX quality of public transport apps for frictionless transportation planning. => Strictly speaking, the UX is not responsible for the transportation but the planning of the commute.
  
For assessing UX quality, Bret Victor's application design philosophy for information software is considered a standard.  => A bit stronger connection to the storyline. 
  
In a case study, the paper compares Berlin's public transportation app [add name here] to Victor's design philosophy and reveals various shortcomings of the app. => This is a tricky sentence. I tried to emphasize your contributions without saying "I / we " or using passive voice. I can live with using the paper as actor but ultimately this is a matter of taste - your choice :D
  
Tram, bus and subway riders could benefit immensely from the improved UX quality of transportation apps based on the discussed design ideas. => Your sentence feels overly complicated to me. Also, it is always nice to re-use keywords from the intro sentence as a framing. But again, this is just a suggestion...Also, I think "improved UX quality of transportation apps" is not ideal but I can't think of an easier wording. I considered "improved UX quality IN transportation apps" but I am not sure if that is correct grammar.
