Some of these questions are optional. If you don't have, for example, further questions about the conference you don't have to submit anything.

## Questions 1 - Topics & Syllabus

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?

HCI is the topic that I'm most interested in because researches can approach this topic in a more explorative and experimental manner in opposition to applied practices of interaction design that  are constrained by commercial goals.
Statistics might also be interesting as knowledge of statistics gives one another dimension of understanding in the information age. "Navigating" data as in sense-making through statistics.

* Are there any topics regarding academic work missing that would interest you or where you need help with?

No

## Question 2 - Research

Explain, what might Einstein have meant in regard to research with saying:

   > Any fool can know. The point is to understand.

He might have meant that there are two types of knowledge. One is the mere memorization of things. The other, deeper kind of knowledge is when you have insight of the topic an explain or build upon the knowledge.

## Questions 3 - Your Paper

Collect topics and keywords as bullet points that could be of interest for you for your paper.  

I recommend to brainstorm for 15min and to write down whatever comes to your mind.

+ Human Computer Interaction
+ UI / UX Research
+ Game Design
