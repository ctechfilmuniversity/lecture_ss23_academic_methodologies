## Task 01.01

## Task 01.05
 My interests could be divided to 3 topics:

1.  The challenges, opportunities and potential of VR technology, as a story telling tool. 
    I want to focus on this subject because VR technology is very appriciated and full of potetntial for creators, but then I am not yet certain what are its advantages for the user (motion sickness, limited Social interaction, limited movement)

2. Worship Technology / technology as the new god / Tech as the replacement of nature.
    I am interested in exploring posthumanism and its alternatives, as well as discovering how modern technology can be utilized or understood from a theological and spiritual perspective.

3. The impact of AI on art/human connection.
    Specifically, I am curious about how AI-generated art (both visual and verbal) will affect our appreciation and valuation of human-made art. Will we begin to prioritize concept over technique, or will new forms of artistic expression emerge as the most highly valued?
