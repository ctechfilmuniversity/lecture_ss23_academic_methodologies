### Your Paper

Task 02.02 - The Storyline of Your Paper
Write down at least three possible (research) questions for your paper.

Tarot AI:
- What is the impact and meaning of AI spiritual practice, for example, Tarot reading, compared to a real-life session? What are the differences and what is the conclusion about the practice itself, and the use of AI for doing it?
- What role can AI play in facilitating personal growth and self-reflection through tarot readings, and how does this compare to more traditional approaches to spiritual guidance?
- How can AI be used to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of tarot readings, and what are the potential risks and limitations of relying on technology in this way?

AI angels:
- AI independence. The fear of Central AI and the similarities to the story of the fallen angel that rebels against god. What can we conclude from this story to analyze and understand our fear better, and to prevent such a scenario as well?
- AI as the god or the messanger? How we can learn from the angelic tradition and apply it to AI development.
We make angels- blade runner

AI art:
- Prompt Art. Is AI art and the use of prompts are a new medium? What would be its effect on other art forms such as illustration, photography, and poetry? Compare the new scenario to previous similar cases like the camera invasion. 

- Would AI replace work and justify basic income.
