How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this lecture so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

-  3.5 

There was not a lot of actual work, but it needed more thought and attention than any other homework

Which one was your favorite chapter, which one your least favorite?

-  I enjoyed most of the lectures a lot, still thinking about the stork experiments. Enjoyed most of the classes about research, reasoning, HCI, and  Experiments. definitely less enjoyed the one about Statistics. Sorry for the very predictable answer :sweat_smile:

Do you feel well prepared to write your short paper? If not, what was missing?

- I am scared, but I think I can do it. Writing it correctly (literature wise) will be hard, but it's a good practice.

Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!

- It was a really nice class. I enjoyed reading the scripts, there were really funny examples and it was nice to have some of your personal experience. Thank you :four_leaf_clover:
