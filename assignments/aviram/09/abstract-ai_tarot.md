Reacearch question:

What are the main guidlines to use AI generative capabilities create an open-reading of tarot while rely on factual information about the cards and their symbolism.

---
With open AI API access, AI reading tools have become accessible for individuals with little to no experience with AI nor Tarot reading. Users may approach these tools with serious questions, struggles, or skepticism. Creating tools that embody the true spirit of Tarot and its therapeutic abilities, even without direct human touch, is essential.

This study examines three AI-generated tools and interviews an expert Tarot reader (or: Can I review the tools toghter with an expert? ask him to review the tools and comment on them?) to establish guidelines for AI reading tools. The goal is to maintain reading integrity while keeping it open for user interpretation. The study aims pin point the rules which help to create an enriching experience that promotes the benefits of Tarot.

By balancing AI generated capabilities with Tarot's spiritual essence, this research will contributes to the development of AI tools that enable meaningful and open Tarot readings. The suggested guidelines will ensure an experience that is profound, therapeutic, and respects user interpretation.

If writing guidelines is too much, then analyse existing tools and methods (whith an expert / only question expert / only analyse?) and write insights that would help establish future guidlines.

  
  
Feedback Lena:
  
* This is a good research question and story line!
* You will need to define in the paper further what you understand as "reading integrity"
* Doing the analysis, involving an expert and developing a guideline is a lot and in my opinion too much for a short paper. But ultimately this is up to you. I recommend to focus on the analysis (with the expert). Then, if you have time and space in the paper left you can always add some recommendations as last section or outlook. 
* Overall you can simplify your language a bit to fit the academic context
* Double-check your spelling
* I like the idea of examining the tools together with the expert. But you will have to find a systematic manner to report on the results (e.g., who says what, what is an opinion, what is a fact?)
