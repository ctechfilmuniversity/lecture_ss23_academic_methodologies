Reacearch question:

What are the main guidlines to use AI generative capabilities create an open-reading of tarot while rely on factual information about the cards and their symbolism.

With open AI API access, AI reading tools have become accessible for individuals with little to no experience with AI nor Tarot reading. Users may approach these tools with serious questions, struggles, or skepticism. Creating tools that embody the true spirit of Tarot and its therapeutic abilities, even without direct human touch, is essential.

This study examines three AI-generated tools and interviews an expert Tarot reader (or: Can I review the tools toghter with an expert? ask him to review the tools and comment on them?) to establish guidelines for AI reading tools. The goal is to maintain reading integrity while keeping it open for user interpretation. The study aims pin point the rules which help to create an enriching experience that promotes the benefits of Tarot.

By balancing AI generated capabilities with Tarot's spiritual essence, this research will contributes to the development of AI tools that enable meaningful and open Tarot readings. The suggested guidelines will ensure an experience that is profound, therapeutic, and respects user interpretation.

If writing guidelines is too much, then analyse existing tools and methods (whith an expert / only question expert / only analyse?) and write insights that would help establish future guidlines.
