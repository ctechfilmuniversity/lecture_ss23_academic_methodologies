# Session 06 - Qualitative Research

We will discuss this session on **June 1st**.  

This session should not take longer than 2h.


## Your Paper

Think about the approach you want to use for your paper. Which methods with which steps do you want to use?  
  
This question does not aim to find your personal journey of investigation. Your task is to define the approach that you will present in a paper as your methodology.  
  

*Submission*: Submit a description of your approach. Bullet points are fine.

**Research Question: How can AI tools for video editing be categorized?**

- choose three or four of those AI tools to analyze them
- find related work on AI tools for video editing and on AI in general (how can AI be differentiated)
- make it a case study
