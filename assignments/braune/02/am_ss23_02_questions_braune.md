## HCI & Finding a Research Question

* Read [Chapter 04 - HCI](../../02_scripts/am_ss23_04_hci_script.md)

### Task 02.01

Which research conflicts or trade-offs are relevant for Creative Technologies?  
Give at least one example.

*Submission:* You do not need to submit anything for this question but we will discuss the answers in class.

## Your Paper

### Task 02.02 - The Storyline of Your Paper

Write down at least three possible (research) questions for your paper. 

* Don't worry about making the question a *research* question. You can think of the questions also as defining the direction for the *storyline* of your paper.
* One question represents one paper (for short papers one question is enough, each question should stand for a different paper)
* Questions can refer to different topics. I recommend to develop for each topic that your are still considering, multiple questions.
  
*Submission:* Submit your possible questions.


> I decided on focusing on the topic of AI tools in video editing.

1. What AI tools for video editing are out there (which are already implemented in software, e.g. Premiere, and which are under development, e.g. Adobe Firefly)?
2. (How) Can the AI tools be differentiated? E.g. one group for "simple" tools that extend possibilites, and one group for tools that can take over tasks from editors (for example AutoPod)
3. Are AI tools really "intelligent"? (Differentiations regarding AI.)
4. Will we need editors in the future?
5. How do AI tools change the content creation process? (New ways of working -> stressful because everything has to be faster VS easier because of helpful tools / more creative freedom because editors can concentrate on the creative tasks instead of the mundane ones VS less creative freedom because AI does everythin.)
6. How do AI tools change the content output? (more content generation, changes in quality...)
