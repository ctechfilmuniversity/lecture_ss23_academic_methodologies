Feedback Lena:

The above still reads more like your "journey of investigation". Here my suggestion:


- Related work on "AI tools for video editing", "Categorizations of AI tools" (?)
- Define a minimal workflow for video editing (based on guidelines and personal experience) and explanation why it is representative
- Definition of the case study:
    - Tool selection
    - Comparison criteria (based on the workflow)
    - Execution and documentation of the comparison
    - Analysis (here I mean how you plan to do it; this highly depends on the chosen criteria)
- Execution of the case study:
    - (Short) description of the selected tools and why they are selected
    -  Short summary of the study's execution, its documentation and analysis
- Description and discussion of insights from your study
- Outlook
