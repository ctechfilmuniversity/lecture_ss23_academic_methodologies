# Session 01 - Introduction (20 Points)

## Task 01.01

* Which of the chapter topics given in the syllabus are of most interest to you? Why?

 The most interesting topic is "Academic Writing" for me. Because I definitely need learn how I can improve my language to write better academic papers. I notice that it is difficult for me to adapt the language style of an academic paper when I write it by myself.

* Are there any topics regarding academic work missing that would interest you or where you need help with?

No, all topics are covered within the lectures.

### Task 01.05 - Topic Selection

From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper.

- AR / VR related topics
    - improvement of userinteraction in VR/AR
    - educational influence of VR/AR
- AI related topics
    - impact on our law of ChatGPT and Midjourney etc.
    - using AI as an AI artist. Can you call yourself really an artist? (academic?)
    - In what way is it realistic that AI takes our jobs? Experiment: AI as social media manager
- Analyse scifi movies/series. What is already reality (technology wise)?
    - e.g Black Mirror
- (Influence of Social Media (TikTok) on music indutry)
    - shorter tracks
    - publishing tracks only if they can be viral on tiktok

Further think about on them. E.g. 

* What specifically interests you within that topic? 
* What further characteristics does the topic have? 
* What questions could you ask within that topic? 
* How could you solve those questions?
