# Session 06 - Quality Research

## Your Paper

Think about the approach you want to use for your paper. Which methods with which steps do you want to use?

Case Study:

Research:
- search for tasks of a content creator on instagram
- research about how to interact with ChatGPT/Midjourney (What prompts are helpful? etc.)

Definition:
- point out the most frequently mentioned tasks of a content creator
- (define a topic of the instagram account)
- define questions that should be ask to the Ai
    - questions that needs to be ask one time
    - questions that needs to be ask daily
- define time frame

Execution:
- ask questions that needs to be ask in the beginning to ChatGPT
- start with the daily questions to ChatGPT
- generate photos with MidJourney
- upload content on instagram
- during the whole time: make a record of all activities
- during the whole time: write down everything that I notice/every thought that could be important for the paper


Feedback Lena:

To me, this means (more condensed):

- Related work on "influencers and digital tools", "AI for creative work"
- Definition of a representative set of tasks that an influencer does
- Definition of the case study: (here I mean how you plan to do it)
    - Task selection 
    - Tool selection
    - Criteria (based on the set of tasks) (in the sense of "what are you analyzing?")
    - Execution and documentation
    - Analysis (this highly depends on the chosen criteria)
- Execution of the case study:
    - Short description of the selected tasks and tools and why they are selected
    - Short summary of the study's execution, its documentation and analysis
- Description and discussion of insights from your study
- Outlook
