## Session 02 - HCI (10 Points)

### Task 02.02 - The Storyline of Your Paper

- What strategies can be used to use Artificial Intelligence to create and manage a instagram profile?
- What restrictions exist when using Artificial Intelligence to do the work of a content creator on instagram?
- How is the success (engagment rate and substantial following) of an Instagram account affected when it is created and managed by an Artificial Intelligence in comparison to a human?

Because it was obvious, I also asked ChatGPT:

1. Can AI successfully create and manage an Instagram account that gains a substantial following?
2. How does the use of AI in creating and managing an Instagram account impact engagement rates?
3. What are the ethical implications of using AI to manage social media accounts?
4. To what extent can AI-generated content effectively replace human-created content on Instagram?
5. How does the use of AI impact the overall user experience of an Instagram account?
6. What types of content are best suited for AI-generated posts on Instagram?
7. How does the use of AI in managing an Instagram account impact the time and resources required for account maintenance?
8. How does the performance of an AI-managed Instagram account compare to a human-managed account in terms of engagement, growth and overall success?
9. What are the potential long-term effects of using AI to manage Instagram accounts on the future of social media management?
10. Can AI accurately capture and reflect the brand voice and personality of a company on Instagram?

Some of the questions aren't good research questions because you can answer them with yes/no or are too general. And some of them wouldn't be manageable because of the ressources that I have. But I think some terms that ChatGPT is using perfectly fitting to the topic of social media (engagement rates, account maintenance, substantial following) and could be included in my research question. And other question are about topics that I haven't thought of.
