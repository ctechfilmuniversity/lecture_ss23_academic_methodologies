## Your Paper



### Task 01.05 - Topic Selection

From your brainstorming output select three topics that you want to consider for your paper.

Further think about on them. E.g.

- What specifically interests you within that topic?
- What further characteristics does the topic have?
- What questions could you ask within that topic?
- How could you solve those questions?

*Submission:* Submit your three topic choices and explain them briefly. If you already have possible questions within those topics, also submit them.

*Paper on Visual software synthesizer built on GPU. Paper includes:* 

*full pipeline (inputs/outputs, controlling devices, data flow, modularity, nodes, stages) as a detailed diagram*

*full concept, including: the goal of the project, instruments and environment that I am using, + roadmap, ways of mapping sound to graphics (as bullet points for researching, and 3-5 usecases for particular algorithms), research of literature about cross-model theories of sound and image, formulation of my personal vision on synergy of sound and image. Also other possible ideas for research and implementation as a bullet points.*

*This paper is combination of applied and partially "pure".* 

*Questions include but not limited to:*

- *what ways is it possible to map visuals to sound*

- *what GPU technics can be used*

- *why even bother? :)*

*How could I solve those questions? Experiments, studying what other people did, and some imagination*

Answer all questions directly in a copy of the `am_ss23_XX_questions.md` file. Submit your copy as `am_ss23_XX_questions_lastname.md` in your assignments folder in a separate folder for each session. I prefer only lower-case characters.

For example: `assignments/gieseke/01/am_ss23_01_questions_gieseke.md`
